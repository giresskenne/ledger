    <h2>General</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">What is Ledger?</div>
      <p>Ledger is a private portfolio tracker for stocks, crypto, real estate, and other assets. It helps you monitor your net worth with real-time market data, all stored securely on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Is Ledger free?</div>
      <p>Yes! Ledger offers a generous free tier with core features. Premium unlocks advanced analytics, AI insights, unlimited assets, and cloud backup for $4.99/month or $39.99/year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Do I need to create an account?</div>
      <p>Nope! Ledger works completely offline without any account, email, or personal information. Just download and start tracking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">What devices does Ledger support?</div>
      <p>Ledger is available for iPhone and iPad running iOS 14 or later. Android and web versions are in development.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Where is my data stored?</div>
      <p>All your portfolio data is stored locally on your device. We never upload your holdings, quantities, or purchase prices to our servers. Premium users can optionally enable encrypted cloud backup.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Can you see my portfolio?</div>
      <p>Absolutely not. Your financial data stays on your device. We have no access to what you own, how much you paid, or your net worth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">How do you make money if the app is private?</div>
      <p>We offer optional Premium subscriptions for advanced features. We never sell user data or show ads—your privacy is not our product.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Is Face ID/Touch ID secure?</div>
      <p>Yes! Biometric locks use Apple's secure enclave. Your fingerprint/face data never leaves your device and cannot be accessed by Ledger or anyone else.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">What asset types can I track?</div>
      <p>Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, cryptocurrency, real estate, vehicles, savings accounts, collectibles, and custom assets. If it has value, you can track it in Ledger.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Do prices update automatically?</div>
      <p>Yes! Stocks and crypto with ticker symbols get automatic price updates during market hours. Manual assets (real estate, cars) require manual value updates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">Can I track multiple portfolios?</div>
      <p>Currently, Ledger supports one consolidated portfolio per device. We're considering multi-portfolio support for a future update.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">How accurate are the prices?</div>
      <p>We use industry-standard APIs (Stooq, Alpha Vantage) with 5-15 minute delays for stocks and real-time data for crypto. Accuracy is high, but verify with your broker for critical decisions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
